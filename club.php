		<h3>Active Listening Club</h3>
		<h4>President, 2021: Liv Slaby</h4>
			<p>The Active Listening Club (ALC) is devoted to the exploration and appreciation of all musics. We gather to share, listen, and learn about the music that our members are passionate about in order to broaden the scope of our listening.<br><br>ALC holds weekly meetings during the academic year for students of any major to talk about music. Meetings often include presentations by members and group discussions of topics in music, as well as trips to local performances and events. Alongside weekly meetings, ALC runs a book club and a podcast.<br><br>Due to the ongoing pandemic, club meetings will be held virtually until further notice.
